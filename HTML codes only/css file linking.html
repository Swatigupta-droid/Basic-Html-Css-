    There are mainly three ways  of inserting a style sheet:

    External CSS
    Internal CSS
    Inline CSS

    External CSS
    With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!

    Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the <link> element, inside the head section

  <!--  Example
External styles are defined within the <link> element, inside the <head> section of an HTML page:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css">
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html> -->

An external style sheet can be written in any text editor, and must be saved with a .css extension.

The external .css file should not contain any HTML tags.
